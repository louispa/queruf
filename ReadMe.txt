This document explains how to run our matlab codes in order to verify their results.
All codes are in the matlab zip.m file "INMA1731_project_gr34"

QUESTION2: - just run the script Q2.m and choose your values for the standard deviation sigma_a and sigma_theta

QUESTION3: - Q3fun.m is the matlab code (function) implementing the sequential Monte Carlo method
	   - draft_3.m is the matlab code (function) that plots what is asked in question 3
	   - Q3.m is the script that need to be run for question 3

QUESTION4: - Q4fun.m is the matlab code (function) implementing the sequential Monte Carlo method
	   - draft_4.m is the matlab code (function) that plots what is asked in question 3
	   - Q4.m is the script that need to be run for question 4

QUESTION5: - Q5fun.m is the matlab code (function) implementing the regularised sequential Monte Carlo method
	   - draft_5.m is the matlab code (function) that plots what is asked in question 3
	   - Q5.m is the script that need to be run for question 5 
           - WARNING: don't forget to set the value of sigma_a to zero in Q4fun.m 

QUESTION6: - Q6fun.m is the matlab code (function) computing the CRLB.
	   - Q6.m is the script that need to be run for question 6. It will generate the asked plot.
